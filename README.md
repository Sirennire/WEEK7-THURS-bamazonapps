# Node.js & MySQL

## Submission Details

* Please find the js files for my Bamazon Node & MySQL apps. To create the MySQL database that corresponds with the code, please copy the `schema.sql` content into your SQL manager and run the commands so you can create the database, the table, and populate it with some data to start with.

* The database & table  _will_ work with both apps; the simple Bamazon customer app (`bamazonCustomer.js`) and the slightly more complex manager app (`bamazonManager.js`). Currently the Supervisor app (`bamazonSupervisor.js`) is still under construction, so you can ignore that js file for the time being.

* You can see [here](https://youtu.be/r5M1Q6aIMYA) how the apps work.

**HINT** Don't forget to run `npm install` to download the latest versions of the node modules you'll need to run this app. They are the same for the simple and complex versions.
